# Titanic_Project
This repository contains Python code and a Jupyter notebook for a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset. By exploring this dataset, my aim is to answer critical questions about the passengers aboard the Titanic and gain insights on the passengers who survived or died.

# Key Features:
  Data Exploration: Dive into the Titanic dataset to understand its structure and content.

  Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and prepare the data for analysis, handling missing values and outliers.

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations among variables.
